# A SIMPLE RAYTRACER MADE WITH OPENGL

This is a (slow, and very bad) ray tracer made in c++ using openGL. Currently This program contains spheres, BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy), and model loading. It was made with [Ray Tracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), and [Sebastian Lague's Ray Tracing](https://github.com/SebLague/Ray-Tracing) as a reference.
